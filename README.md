# Intelligent Garbage Classification using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to create an intelligent garbage classification system using deep learning techniques. The system will automatically classify different types of garbage into predefined categories such as recyclable, non-recyclable, organic, and hazardous waste. Deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), will be utilized to achieve high accuracy in garbage classification.

## Introduction

Garbage classification is a critical task in waste management systems to enable efficient recycling and disposal. Traditional methods of manual garbage sorting are time-consuming and error-prone. This project offers an intelligent solution using deep learning to automate the classification process. The trained model can be deployed in various settings, such as smart waste bins, recycling plants, or municipal garbage collection centers.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0) or Keras (>=2.0)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/intelligent-garbage-classification.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
```
3. run the application locally
   ```bash
python app.py
```
## Dataset

The success of deep learning models heavily relies on the quality and diversity of the dataset used for training. You can use existing garbage classification datasets or create your own dataset by collecting images of different garbage items and labeling them into respective categories.

For instance, consider the following structure for your dataset:

```
dataset/
|-- cardboard/
|   |-- img1.jpg
|   |-- img2.jpg
|   |-- ...
|-- Glass/
|   |-- img1.jpg
|   |-- img2.jpg
|   |-- ...
|-- Paper/
|   |-- img1.jpg
|   |-- img2.jpg
|   |-- ...
|-- Plastic/
|   |-- img1.jpg
|   |-- img2.jpg
|   |-- ...
```

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model for garbage classification will be based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. CNNs are known for their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from images. You can use pre-trained CNN architectures such as ResNet, VGG, or Inception, or design a custom CNN architecture according to the dataset size and complexity.

## Training

To train the deep learning model, you can use the provided Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks in the repository. Make sure to configure the model parameters, such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs, to achieve optimal performance.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset to measure its performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Use confusion matrices and visualizations to gain insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses.

## Usage

Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can deploy it for intelligent garbage classification. The model can be integrated into a garbage collection system or embedded within smart waste bins to automatically sort the garbage.
